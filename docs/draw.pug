    We are submitting our manuscript entitled *"On the creation of beautiful PDF
    files using yet another HTML converter but this one has a cool name"* to your
    *Journal of Incremental Software*, which we believe is the best indicated to
    publish this work (now that every bigger journal has said no).

    In this paper we present ReLaXed, a new framework for the interactive
    generation of PDFs using web technologies, in particular the *Pug* language.
    While many other software exist to produce high quality PDF files, they
    generally lack the cool packaging and novelty of Relaxed.JS (and by
    "novelty", we really mean "recentness"). At this time, Relaxed.JS already
    has one active user, and we expect this number to grow several-fold after
    publication in your journal.

    We believe that this new piece of software would find an important echo in
    your audience, in particular among developers interested in the creation of
    beautiful PDF files using web technologies, in particular the *Pug*
    language. Please publish us pretty please.

.closing Yours sincelerely,
